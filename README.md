# Flight Ticket Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the price of flight tickets based on various factors such as destination, travel date, booking time, airline, travel class, and seat availability.

## Features
- Predict flight ticket prices accurately using historical data.
- Interactive dashboard for data visualization and predictions.
- Insightful analysis of factors influencing price changes.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather historical ticket price data from airline APIs or public datasets.
   - Include additional features like travel season, distance, and seat availability.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean the data and handle missing or inconsistent values.
   - Perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

3. **Model Development**
   - Train and test machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, or R².

4. **Visualization and Deployment**
   - Build a dashboard to visualize key data and predictions.
   - Deploy the model as an API or web application for real-world use.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database:** MySQL or MongoDB
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Plotly, or Dash
- **Deployment:** Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd flight-price-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Launch the web application for predictions:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the application.
